A command-line tool to validate equipment registers and connection files that are used by [msl-equipment](https://pypi.org/project/msl-equipment/).

## Install
`msl-equipment-validate` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/msl-equipment-validate/) and can be installed with a variety of Python package managers (e.g., pip, pipx, uv, ...). The following command uses pip

```console
pip install msl-equipment-validate
```

If you used a package manager that does not automatically add the `msl-equipment-validate` executable to your PATH environment variable (without activating a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)), you may want to add the directory to where the `msl-equipment-validate` executable is located to your PATH. This will allow you to validate XML documents from any directory without having to first activate a virtual environment.

## Documentation
The documentation for `msl-equipment-validate` can be found [here](https://mslnz.github.io/msl-equipment/dev/validate).
