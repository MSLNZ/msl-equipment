Compatibility
-------------
**MSL-Equipment** is tested with Python 2.7, 3.4+. However, some of the :ref:`resources`
might not work in your application because the resource might depend on an external
dependency (e.g., the SDK provided by a manufacturer) and this external dependency
might not be available for your operating system.
