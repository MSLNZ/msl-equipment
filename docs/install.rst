Compatibility
-------------
**MSL-Equipment** has been tested with Python versions 2.7, 3.3 - 3.6. However, some of the :ref:`resources`
might not work in your application simply because the resource might depend on an external library (e.g.,
the SDK provided by a manufacturer) and this external dependency might not be available for your operating system.
