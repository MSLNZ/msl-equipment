# msl-equipment-resources

Resources to communicate with equipment.

## Compatibility
`msl-equipment` is tested with Python 3.8+ on Windows, Linux and macOS; however, some of the [resources] might not work for your application because the resource may depend on an external dependency (e.g., the SDK provided by a manufacturer) and this external dependency might not be available for your operating system.
